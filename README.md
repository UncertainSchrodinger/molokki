# Molokki

Monorepo for all my personal projects.

I got bored of tracking all my unfinished projects across multiple repos and
often I didn't even bother pushing them to Github. Hence molokki was born to
have one repo to store all code.

Molokki is a Finnish word for a garbage can that extends underground.
