# Fallout Save Editor

Save game editor for Fallout 2.

Features:

* None, does nothing

Todo:

* Remove NCR aggro

# But why?

Ain't downloading no random ass compiled editor from a mod site.

Also fucking Sulik didn't put his weapon away and now half of NCR want's to kill
me. Some how I felt the best response would be to make my own editor and
introduce some binary protocol forced positivity into NCR.
